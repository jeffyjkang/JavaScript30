      const team = players;
      // not the same as strings, numbers, booleans
      console.log(players, team);
      // team[3] = "Lux";

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      //slice shallow copy
      team2[3] = "Lux";
      console.log(players, team2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[2] = "Max";
      console.log(players, team2, team3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[1] = "Jen";
      //another with Array.from()
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[0] = "Jeff";
      console.log(players, team2, team3, team4, team5);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(person, captain);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 23 });
      console.log(captain, cap2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      //works
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      cap3.number = 12;
      console.log(person, cap3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

        name: "wes",
        age: 100,

      dev.social.twitter = "@coolman";
      //changes both wes and dev object
      console.log(wes, dev);

      //hacky way to deepclone and not change both, stringify wes then parse to json
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
